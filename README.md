# ðŸš§ [WIP] A beautiful online markdown editor

I wanted a place where I could write my blog posts in markdown with a real-time preview, without the need to switch views.

While there are a few web apps out there where I could achieve this, couldn't find one with a clean and beautiful user interface that allows me to resize sections to whatever feels comfortable at any moment.

That's why I decided to create my own online markdown editor using Next.js and Tailwind, inlcuding Vitest for unit testing.
